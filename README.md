##  Overview
**ReconOrchestrator** is a lightweight, Python-based concurrency wrapper engineered to automate multi-target web security assessments safely. 

Modern cloud infrastructure utilizes aggressive Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and rate-limiting algorithms that immediately block brute-force directory discovery tools. Furthermore, running high-speed multi-target scans can rapidly exhaust local system resources and cause local network port exhaustion.

This tool solves both problems. It acts as an intelligent governor for high-speed fuzzing tools (specifically `ffuf`), enforcing strict thread limits, adaptive backoff strategies, and pre-scan heuristics to safely scan hundreds of targets simultaneously without crashing local hardware or triggering remote IP bans.

---


##  Features

  *  **Strict Concurrency** - Multi-threaded processing with hard-capped workers to prevent local hardware exhaustion.
  *  **Adaptive Rate-Limiting** - Exponential backoff automatically triggers upon detecting `429` or `403` WAF mitigation responses.
  *  **Smart Pre-Probing** - Lightweight liveness checks drop dead infrastructure before heavy fuzzing begins.
  *  **Intelligent Noise Reduction** - Dynamic auto-calibration filters out generic wildcard `301` and `200` responses.
  *  **Advanced IDS Evasion** - Implements execution jitter, target shuffling, and dynamic User-Agent cycling.

##  Installation

**From Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akhter313/ReconOrchestrator.git
cd ReconOrchestrator

# Initialize virtual environment (Recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install requests urllib3
```

*Note: Ensure you have `ffuf` installed and accessible in your system's PATH.*

##  Usage

**Basic Usage**

```bash
# Ensure targets.txt and wordlist.txt are populated, then run:
python3 recon_orchestrator.py
```

##  Core Architecture

ReconOrchestrator bridges the gap between raw speed and connection stability:

| Mechanism | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ThreadPoolExecutor** | Hard-caps concurrent background processes. | Prevents local router packet drops. |
| **Requests Timeout** | 5-second lightweight pre-scan check. | Saves time on unresolvable DNS/dead IPs. |
| **Subprocess Regex** | Monitors stdout for 429/403 blocks. | Evades Cloudflare/Akamai bot detection. |
| **Auto-Calibration** | Analyzes baseline WAF responses. | Eliminates false-positive logs. |

##  Bug Bounty Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d target.com -o subdomains.txt

# Step 2: Resolve alive hosts (Optional, though ReconOrchestrator handles this)
cat subdomains.txt | httpx -mc 200 -o targets.txt

# Step 3: Run the Orchestrator
python3 recon_orchestrator.py

# Step 4: Pass valid findings directly to vulnerability scanners
cat results.txt | nuclei -t vulnerabilities/
```



##  Input File Formats

**targets.txt**

```text
https://example.com
https://api.example.com
https://dev.example.com
```

**wordlist.txt**

```text
admin
login
api
dashboard
v1
```

##  How It Works

1.   **Input Processing** - Reads targets and wordlists, shuffling the array to distribute load.
2.   **Liveness Probing** - Pings the host with randomized User-Agents to verify uptime.
3.   **Thread Assignment** - Spawns a dedicated worker using the ThreadPool limits.
4.   **Fuzzing Execution** - Invokes `ffuf` with auto-calibration and silent flags.
5.   **Telemetry Analysis** - Intercepts the WAF response; pauses the thread if rate-limited.
6.   **Output Generation** - Appends only 100% valid, verified hits to `results.txt`.
